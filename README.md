# What MLB Pitcher(s) are You Similar to?
### About
This is still very much a work in progress, my plans for this project are as follows:
* End goal: create an application that takes input from pitchers on their handedness/arm slot/pitch types and returns a list of mlb pitchers that they are similar to. These results could be useful for pitchers who are looking for references and role models in pitching mechanics and approach.
### Process
* create python backend for comparing input to mlb pitchers
* create react frontend to provide input for comparison and to return results
